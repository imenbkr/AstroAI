# Nasa-SpaceApps-Challenge2024

The goal is to develop an algorithm that can distinguish seismic events (quakes) from noise in the provided datasets, ideally improving the transmission efficiency by only sending back relevant data to Earth.

## the Data:
In the data provided in the Jupyter notebook. We have:

1- Seismic Records: These are time-series data that contain both quakes and noise. </br>
2- Catalogs: These contain the times when quakes are known to occur (in the training data). This can be used to train or validate your model. </br>
3- Test Data: This is what you'll use to test your algorithm and see if you can accurately find seismic events.
